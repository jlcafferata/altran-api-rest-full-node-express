Api REST Full Node 6 JS and Express.

Previous configurations:

- Install npm (if you do not already have it installed).
- Execute the command "npm install" from the command line, being positioned in the project directory
- Once the necessary packages are installed for the api to work, you can run the same with the command: "node app" or "npm start". It will be accessible through port 3000 (by default).

Benefits of the api:

The api has the following functionalities:
- Access control, through access to remote url.
- Token creation once the user has validated.
- User queries (through id or name) or policies (through id or policy number), accessing remote urls to feed data. Access to information is restricted to the role of the logged in user (token information).
